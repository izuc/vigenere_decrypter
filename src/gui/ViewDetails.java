/**
 * The ViewDetails class is used to show further details based on the message 
 * decryption; showing comparison between the decrypted message letter frequencies 
 * and the language average. The comparison between the letter frequencies are 
 * displayed in two approaches: The first being a bar graph overview - which 
 * shows the comparison for each letter, and the second being a more in-depth view
 * showing the rounded differences (within a JTable). The class extends JDialog,
 * therefore the instance itself is a dialog box. The user can also navigate between
 * decrypted messages, since the constructor must receive the parent VigenereGui -
 * it allows for the retrieval of the selected decrypted message, with also the ability to
 * navigate throughout the elements.
