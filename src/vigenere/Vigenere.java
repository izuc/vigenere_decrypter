/**
The Vigenere class contains the core functionality of the application.
 * The class has methods used for loading the three text files (letter
 * frequency, keywords, cipher text) and converts them into usable data
 * structures. The class was designed to keep expansion in mind, and not only
 * comprises the functionality to decrypt files - but to also encrypt them.
 * 
 * The class also contains methods (getSubsets(), getCipherKey(),
 * commonDivisor(), and getCipherKey()) which attempt to find the keyword used
 * in the loaded Ciphertext (without being given the keyword file); which is
 * done by using the Kasiski method to find the key length - dividing the
 * Ciphertext into repeating subsets of 3 characters. It stores the data, and
 * for each subset (that matches the highest amount of repeating groups) it
 * finds the greatest common divider for the distance between repeating subsets
 * (which is the most likely the keyword's length). Once the keyword length has
 * been found, the length of the keyword is iterated; with each character in the
 * Ciphertext being counted (incrementing on the keyword length), and through
 * Interwoven Caesar Shifts it finds the letter with the highest calculated
 * frequency analysis value. The letter found is then appended to a character
 * array - with the next iteration in the keyword length being performed
 * (eventually leading to a fully formed keyword).
 *
 * The algorithm and formulas used for the Kasiski method and Interwoven Caesar
 * Shifts was adapted into this application; which was explained in the book
 * "Cryptography â€“ Theory and Practice (3rd edition)" written by Douglas R.
 * Stinson and published in 2006 (on page 32-36). The code was not copied,
 * but however was written based on his explanation.

     * The cipher method is used to encrypt, and decrypt messages (the received
     * Boolean indicates the formula which will be used). The Ciphertext String
     * (which was loaded via a file) is iterated for each character value. A
     * variable is used to keep track of the index position for the keyword;
     * which is incremented, and then reset back to zero once the keyword length
     * has been reached. This allows for the keyword to be repetitively cycled
     * whilst iterating through each character in the Ciphertext, therefore each
     * loop will be specifying a letter character, and the corresponding keyword
     * character. Both character values are then found in the Letter structure,
     * which grabs the position index - assigning it to their own local variables.
     * The formula used to calculate the letter depends on the received Boolean.
     * If the Boolean is true (being you are encrypting) then the letter position
     * and key position is added together, otherwise the letter position is
     * subtracted from the key position.
     *
     * The modulus of the resulting value is then calculated based on the Letter
     * structure size, which is then used as the index position to fetch a
     * Letter object (from the Letter structure). If the method is decrypting,
     * then the Letter object invokes a method which increments a counter tally.
     * The Letter object then fetches the inner character value, and appends it
     * to a StringBuilder object (being essentially a wrapped character array).
     * The resulting message is then returned as a String.
     * @param key String - The Keyword used for the encryption/ decryption.
